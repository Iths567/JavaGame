# JavaGame
This is a game made in Processing IDE for a Uni assignment

This was a game made in the horrible processing IDE which is used to help beginners learn Java at a very basic level. 
I hated every minute of the IDE and did the bare minimum that I had to so i could stop using it. 
That's probably not something I should admit and share, but alas here is the worst game that you'll probably see.
